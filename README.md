# Shopify Store Theme Activity

## What does it do?

This is a browser extension that monitors your theme activity aross multiple stores and places them in a convenient Popup. The idea came from an apparent frustration in constantly having to search a store, open the relevant theme and then need to do it again 5 minutes later for a different store. The hope is that this will save a lot of time over the course of a day/week and minimise the number of times you find yourself returning to the same theme by always having them to hand!

One of the early principles of this extension has been to only read from the DOM and to not manipulate or insert anything. Ie. Avoid the use of "Copy url" buttons etc.


## Roadmap
[x] Add ability to remove themes one by one.
[x] Edit Code link
[] Options page 
[] Text box for useful messaging to AMs/PMs. Ie. "Please checkout the latest theme features from this url: *theme_url*"
[] Update name?
[] Update icon


## Installation

Until this becomes available on the extension store you will need to enable dev mode on your browser's extension window and then hit "Load unpacked" (or similar) and load the **build** folder.
